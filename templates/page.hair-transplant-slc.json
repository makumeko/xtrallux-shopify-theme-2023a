The thought of all the research, money, and travel time could be exhausting.<br\/><br\/>I get it. Hair loss isn’t about only hair; it’s a mental health problem. Hair loss transcends mere aesthetics; it often bears an emotional weight that can shake the very foundations of one’s self-confidence and identity. It’s a silent struggle that many face, but few openly discuss.<br\/><br\/>But look, if you have had a hair transplant or are planning to get one, you should know this:<strong> A hair transplant isn’t enough.<\/strong> Why?
